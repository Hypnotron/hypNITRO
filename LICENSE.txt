      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license doc
ument, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and
 conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the 
additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.
As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Pub
lic License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public Lic
ense.

"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an A
pplication or a Combined Work as defined below.

An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Libr
ary, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a c
lass defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by t
he Library.

A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with
 the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work
 was made is also called the "Linked Version".

The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding S
ource for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combi
ned Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on
 the Linked Version.

The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the object code a
nd/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs n
eeded for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the 
System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without bei
ng bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
2. Conveying Modified Versions.
If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refe
rs to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility
 (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may c
onvey a copy of the modified version:
a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that
, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility
 still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, o
r
b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License ap
plicable to that copy.
3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header fi
le that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of y
our choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numeri
cal parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline fu
nctions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the followi
ng:
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is u
sed in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license documen
t.
4. Combined Works.
You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, 
effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library containe
d in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications,
 if you also do each of the following:
a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is
 used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license docum
ent.
c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include
 the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a referenc
e directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
d) Do one of the following:
0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and 
the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that 
permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version 
of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specifi
ed by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suita
ble mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already pre
sent on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modifie
d version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.
e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required
 to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the ext
ent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version
 of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with 
a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installati
on Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding
 Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Info
rmation in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corres
ponding Source.)
5. Combined Libraries.
You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by si
de in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Appli
cations and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library 
under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Libr
ary, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of t
his License.
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work bas
ed on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form
 of the same work.
6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU 
Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be simil
ar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new pro
blems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you rec
eived it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Pub
lic License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of followi
ng the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later ver
sion published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received i
t does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, yo
u may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published
 by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether futu
re versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's p
ublic statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you 
to choose that version for the Library.
